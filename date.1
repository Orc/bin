.Sh NAME
.Nm date
.Nd display or set date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl auV
.Op Cm + Ns Ar format
.Nm
.Op Fl u
.Ar [cc]yymmddhhmm[.ss]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the current date and time when invoked without arguments.
Providing arguments will format the date and time in a user-defined
way or set the date.  Only the superuser may set the date.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display the Information Superhighway time  (It's always September
on the Information Superhighway.)
.It Fl u
Display or set the date in
.Tn UTC
(universal) time.
.It Fl V
Show the toolkit version, then exit.
.El
.Pp
An operand with a leading plus (``+'') sign signals a user-defined format
string which specifies the format in which to display the date and time.
The format string may contain any of the conversion specifications described
in the 
.Xr strftime 3
manual page, as well as any arbitrary text.
A <newline> character is always output after the characters specified by
the format string.
The format string for the default display is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
``%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y''.
.Ed
.Pp
If an operand does not have a leading plus sign, it is interpreted as
a value for setting the system's notion of the current date and time.
The canonical representation for setting the date and time is:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar cc
The first two digits of the year (the century).
.It Ar yy
The second two digits of the year.
If
.Dq cc
is not specified, it sets the year within the current
century.
.It Ar mm
The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
.It Ar dd
The day of the month, from 1 to 31.
.It Ar hh
The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
.It Ar mm
The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
.It Ar ss
The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
.El
.Pp
Time changes for Daylight Saving and Standard time and leap seconds
and years are handled automatically.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm
:
.Bl -tag -width TZ
.It Ev TZ
The timezone to use when displaying dates.
See
.Xr environ 7
for more information.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/messages -compact
.\" .It Pa /var/log/wtmp
.\" A record of date resets and time changes.
.It Pa /var/log/messages
A record of the user setting the time.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
date "+DATE: %m/%d/%y%nTIME: %H:%M:%S"
.Ed
.Pp
will display:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
DATE: 11/21/87
TIME: 13:36:16
.Ed
.Pp
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
date 061316271985
.Ed
.Pp
sets the date to
.Dq Li "June 13, 1985, 4:27 PM" .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The following exit values are returned:
 0    The date was written successfully (either locally or globally)
 >0   An error occurred.
.Sh BUGS
The computation of Information Superhighway time does not include leap
seconds, so it will become increasingly inaccurate as time goes on.

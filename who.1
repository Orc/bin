.Pa /var/log/utmp .
An alternate
.Ar file
may be specified which is usually
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
The
.Pa wtmp
file contains a record of every login, logout,
crash, shutdown and date change
since
.Pa wtmp
was last truncated or
created.

If
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
is being used as the file, the user name may be empty
or one of the special characters '|', '}' and '~'.
Logouts produce
an output line without any user name.

special characters, see
